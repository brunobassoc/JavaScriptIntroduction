Welcome to my GitHub repository!

Here you'll find a collection of exercises completed during my Special Topics in Programming class, focusing on frontend development. As a newcomer to JavaScript, these exercises primarily cover basic commands and concepts. I began my journey with JavaScript on 05/04/2024, and I'm excited to showcase my progress and document my learning journey. Feel free to explore and provide any feedback or suggestions.

Thank you for visiting!
